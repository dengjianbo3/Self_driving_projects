# Udacity self driving projects

## Descritions

This repositroy contains require projects of Udacity self driving car engineer nano-degree. Udacity self driving degree contain lots of useful courses and projects to help me get into self driving industry, including vision system like lane line detection, or traffic sign classifer with deep learning model, and sensor fusion like extended kalman filter, or some technology beyone like using imitation learing to control a vechicle in the simulator. Also along with further session trajectory, I could learn SLAM and other interesting and useful skills to help me dive in to self driving career.
